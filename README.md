# Python-Reddit-Bot
A program that extracts data from a skype database chat and generates markov chain bots to post on a specified subreddit.

## Things to note for personal use:
Running chat_extractor.py with modified convo_id will create a .pkl object to be accessed by the bot.py file.
All other files should not be run.
